## Features

### Intro Section

The intro section greets our enthusiastic freshers with a warm "Hello!" and a hearty welcome to the CS Department. 🎓 I've sprinkled some memes and GIFs to give you a sneak peek into the rollercoaster journey that lies ahead!

### Dare Base Game System

🎮 Ready for some fun? Our dare-based game system is where the magic happens! Freshers can dive into a game of dares by clicking on a button. Once the button is clicked, a dare is randomly selected from our list of thought-provoking questions. Get ready to introduce yourselves and embrace the challenge! 💃🕺
